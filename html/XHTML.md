## Why XHTML?
XHTML was developed to make HTML more extensible and flexible to work with other data formats (such as XML). In addition, browsers ignore errors in HTML pages, and try to display the website even if it has some errors in the markup. So XHTML comes with a much stricter error handling.

## The Most Important Differences from HTML

- The xmlns attribute in <html> is mandatory
<html>, <head>, <title>, and <body> are mandatory
- Elements must always be properly nested
- Elements must always be closed
- Elements must always be in lowercase
- Attribute names must always be in lowercase
