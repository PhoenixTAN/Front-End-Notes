        <div class="right">The Promise.all() method takes an iterable of promises as an input, and returns a single Promise that resolves to an array of the results of the input promises. This returned promise will resolve when all of the input's promises have resolved, or if the input iterable contains no promises. It rejects immediately upon any of the input promises rejecting or non-promises throwing an error, and will reject with this first rejection message / error.
            It is typically used when there are multiple asynchronous tasks that are dependent on one another to complete successfully, as it does not wait and will reject immediately upon any of the input promises rejecting.
            In comparison, the promise returned by Promise.allSettled() will wait for all input promises to complete, regardless of whether or not one rejects. Consequently, it will always return the final result of every promise and function from the input iterable.
