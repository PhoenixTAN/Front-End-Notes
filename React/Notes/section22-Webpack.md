# Webpack

Webpack is an open-source JavaScript module bundler. It is made primarily for JavaScript, but it can transform front-end assets like HTML, CSS, and images if the corresponding loaders are included. webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.

4. output (eg: dist/bundle.js)

## Basic Workflow Requirements
1. Compile Next-Gen Javascript Features
2. Handle JSX
3. CSS Autoprefixing
4. Suport image imports
5. Optimize Code
