# Git Remotes

Remote repositories have a bunch of great properties

1. Remotes serve as a great backup! Local git repositories have the ability to restore files to a previous state (as you know), but all that information is stored locally. By having copies of your git repository on other computers, you can lose all your local data and still pick up where you left off.
2. Remotes make coding social! Now that a copy of your project is hosted elsewhere, your friends can contribute to your project (or pull in your latest changes) very easily.

## git clone
