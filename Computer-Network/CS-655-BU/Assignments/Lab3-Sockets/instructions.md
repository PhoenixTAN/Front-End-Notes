# Lab 3 instructions
You need to create a client that initiates a TCP connection to a server and writes a single line: your BU ID in this format: "BU#\n". E.g., "BU1234567". "\n" means you should also send the newline character. In order to make sure your BU ID is successfully submitted, read the response (also one line) from the server.

The server is pcvm10-1.instageni.arc.vt.edu , port 55555.

No need to turn anything in. You will get all points if you successfully submit your BU ID by Monday 11pm.

For implementing your client, you can get inspiration from the simple client/server code on the Resources page.
